## Startup MongoDb networked instances
Start three instances of MongoDb each running in a docker container of it's own but arranged so that all three containers are in the same Docker network. Use the ***create-mongo-networked-instances.yml*** docker-compose file for this.  

The three instances are not yet configured to be in a cluster or secured.
